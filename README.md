# Webhook Deployment

This repository contains a script that automates the deployment process of a web application using webhooks. When a webhook is triggered (usually by a commit or push to a specific branch in a Git repository), the script pulls the latest changes, builds the application, and deploys it to the server.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you will need to have your web application hosted on a Git repository and a server set up to host the application. You will also need to set up a webhook on your Git repository that triggers when changes are pushed to a specific branch.
